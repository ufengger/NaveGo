function fb = acc_nav2body (acc_n, DCMnb)
% acc_nav2body: transform accelerations from navigation frame to body
% 				frame.
% INPUT:
%		acc_n: Nx3 matrix with [fn, fe, fd] accelerations in the navigation
%		frame.
%		DCMnb: Nx9 matrix with nav-to-body direct cosine matrix (DCM).
%		Each row contains [a11 a21 a31 a12 a22 a32 a13 a23 a33] elements
%		from each DCM.
%
% OUTPUT:
%		fb: Nx3 matrix with [fx, fy, fz] simulated accelerations in the
%		body frame.
