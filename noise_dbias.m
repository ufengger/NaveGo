function [dbias_n] = noise_dbias (b_corr, b_drift, dt, M)
% noise_dbias: generates a dynamic bias perturbation.
%
% INPUT:
%		b_corr: 1x3, correlation times.
%       b_drift: 1x3, level of dynamic biases.
%       dt: sample time.
%		M: 1x2, dimension of output vector.
%
% OUTPUT:
%		dbias_n: M matrix with [x, y, z] simulated dynamic biases.
