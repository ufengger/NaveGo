function [vel_ned, acc_ned] = pllh2vned (ref)
% pllh2vned: generates NED accelerations and velocities from 
% navigation position.
%
% INPUT:
%		ref: data structure with true trajectory.
%
% OUTPUT:
%		vel_ned: Nx3 matrix with [Vn Ve Vd] velocities in the NED frame.
%		acc_ned: Nx3 matrix with [An Ae Ad] accelerations in the NED frame.
